        <h3 id="food-insec1">What is food insecurity?</h3>
            <p id="answer-1">Food insecurity is a household's inability to provide enough food for every person to live a healthy, active lifestyle. 
            Children face the biggest risk of living with food insecurity, with detrimental effects to their development, health, and growth. 
            In the United States, 14.3 million American households were considered food insecure, while 11 million children lived in food insecure households.
            Most alarmingly, studies have shown that the average American family is just one "bad month" away from plunging into food insecurity.</p>

            <p id="answer-2"> There is not one underlying cause to food insecurity, making it difficult to address and combat the issue of hunger. Several 
                factors that contribute to this long-standing issue are: health complications, geographical location, inconsistent access to healthy food/grocery stores, layoffs, fixed incomes, and underemployment.
            </p>

        <h3 id="food-insec2">How can I help?</h3>
            <p id="answer-3">Start by utilizing this app! The purpose of Food 4 All is to raise awareness around food insecurity and connect users to local food banks, shelters, and other resources where they can volunteer and 
                participate in providing food and other items to those in need in their local community.</p>

        <h3 id="food-insec3">What if I'm in need?</h3>
            <p id="answer-5">If you are currently in need and would like to know more about how to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, please refer to the <a id="snap-link2" href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory">USDA's SNAP Directory of Resources</a> 
                        to learn how to apply, qualify, and receive assistance in obtaining healthy, nutritious food.</p>

            <p id="answer-4">If you are currently a SNAP participant, you can use <a id="snap-link1" href="https://usda-fns.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=e1f3028b217344d78b324193b10375e4">the USDA's SNAP Retailers Web Map</a> to find grocery
                stores near you that accept your SNAP benefits.</p>
