        <h3 id="food-insec1">1. What is food insecurity?</h3>
            <p id="answer-1">Food insecurity is a household's inability to provide enough food for every person to live a healthy, active lifestyle. 
            Children face the biggest risk of living with food insecurity, with detrimental effects to their development, health, and growth. 
            In the United States, 14.3 million American households were considered food insecure, while 11 million children lived in food insecure households.
            Most alarmingly, studies have shown that the average American family is just one "bad month" away from plunging into food insecurity.</p>

            <p id="answer-2"> There is not one underlying cause to food insecurity, making it difficult to address and combat the issue of hunger. Several 
                factors that contribute to this long-standing issue are: health complications, geographical location, inconsistent access to healthy food/grocery stores, layoffs, fixed incomes, and underemployment.
            </p>

        <h3 id="food-insec2">2. My family and/or I are in need of food assistance. How can I sign up for SNAP?</h3>
            <p id="answer-3">If you are currently in need and would like to know more about how to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, please refer to the <a id="snap-link2" href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-directory">USDA's SNAP Directory of Resources</a>
